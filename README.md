===================

The [Bradley-Terry
Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley%E2%80%93Terry_model) is useful when
comparing the results of a bunch of pairings to see what item is most relevant
or best choice. 

It's also used a bunch to determine the best team to bet on.

I wrote this version because I need to compare the preferred pieces of equipment at a playground, and didn't want to have to call out to Python or R to get the correct answer.
